# Udacity-VRND-Maze  
This project is a fully interactive VR experience in the form of a maze.  
## What I've learned in this project:  
* Waypoint Navigation so user can move through the maze.  
* Creating collectable key and coins which play a sound and spawn some particles when you click on.  
* Adding some AI to game, so the gate opens if user has collected the key.  
* Creating and accessing prefab via script.  
* Adding Ui to congratulate user when he/she finished the game.  
* Scene management so user can replay the game or just exit.  

## How to run

Open the project in Unity.   
Import the Google VR SDK package.  
Set "VR Mode Enabled" to true in GvrViewerMain.  
Build and run tihs app.  
Or you can also install /Build/VRWorld.apk into your phone.
